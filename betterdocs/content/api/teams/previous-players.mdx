result = vlr.teams.previous_players(
    team_id: int,
    timeout: float = 5.0
) -> list[PreviousPlayer]
```

## Parameters

<TypeTable
  type={{
    team_id: {
      type: 'int',
      description: 'Team ID',
      required: true,
    },
    timeout: {
      type: 'float',
      description: 'Request timeout in seconds',
      default: '5.0',
    },
  }}
/>

## Return Value

**Type:** `list[PreviousPlayer]`

Returns a list of previous and current players sorted by most recent activity.

<TypeTable
  type={{
    player_id: {
      type: 'int | None',
      description: 'Player ID',
    },
    ign: {
      type: 'str | None',
      description: 'In-game name',
    },
    real_name: {
      type: 'str | None',
      description: 'Real name',
    },
    country: {
      type: 'str | None',
      description: 'Country',
    },
    position: {
      type: 'str | None',
      description: 'Position (e.g., "Player", "Head Coach")',
    },
    status: {
      type: 'str',
      typeDescription: '"Active" | "Left" | "Inactive" | "Unknown"',
      description: 'Calculated player status',
      required: true,
    },
    join_date: {
      type: 'date | None',
      description: 'Most recent join date',
    },
    leave_date: {
      type: 'date | None',
      description: 'Most recent leave/inactive date',
    },
    transactions: {
      type: 'list[PlayerTransaction]',
      description: 'All transactions for this player (always a list, may be empty)',
      required: true,
    },
  }}
/>

## Status Determination

Status is calculated from the most recent transaction with a known date:

- **Active**: Player has joined and has no subsequent leave/inactive action
- **Left**: Player has a "leave" action as their most recent status change
- **Inactive**: Player has an "inactive" action as their most recent status change
- **Unknown**: Cannot determine status from available transactions

## Examples

### Get Previous Players

```python title="Get previous players"
import vlrdevapi as vlr

# Get all players
players = vlr.teams.previous_players(team_id=1034)

print(f"Total players: {len(players)}")
for player in players[:10]:  # Show first 10
    print(f"{player.ign} - {player.status} ({player.position})")
    join_str = player.join_date.strftime('%Y/%m/%d') if player.join_date else 'Unknown'
    leave_str = player.leave_date.strftime('%Y/%m/%d') if player.leave_date else 'None'
    print(f"  Joined: {join_str}, Left: {leave_str}")
```

### Filter by Status

```python title="Filter by status"
import vlrdevapi as vlr

players = vlr.teams.previous_players(team_id=1034)

# Filter by status
active = [p for p in players if p.status == "Active"]
left = [p for p in players if p.status == "Left"]
inactive = [p for p in players if p.status == "Inactive"]

print(f"Active: {len(active)}")
print(f"Left: {len(left)}")
print(f"Inactive: {len(inactive)}")

# Show active players
for player in active:
    print(f"  {player.ign} - {player.position}")
```

### Filter by Position

```python title="Filter by position"
import vlrdevapi as vlr

players = vlr.teams.previous_players(team_id=1034)

# Get coaches
coaches = [p for p in players if p.position and "coach" in p.position.lower()]

print(f"Coaches: {len(coaches)}")
for coach in coaches:
    print(f"  {coach.real_name or coach.ign} - {coach.status}")
```

### Access Transaction History

```python title="Access transaction history"
import vlrdevapi as vlr

players = vlr.teams.previous_players(team_id=1034)

if players:
    player = players[0]
    print(f"Transaction history for {player.ign}:")
    for txn in player.transactions:
        date_str = txn.date.strftime('%Y/%m/%d') if txn.date else 'Unknown'
        print(f"  {date_str}: {txn.action}")
```

## Error Handling

- **Network failures**: Returns an empty list `[]`
- **Invalid team ID**: Returns an empty list `[]`
- **No transactions**: Returns an empty list `[]`
- **Players without player_id**: Excluded from results

The function never raises exceptions, making it safe to use without try-catch blocks.

## Tips

- Check list length before accessing: `if players:`
- All optional fields can be `None` - check before using
- Use this instead of `transactions()` when you need calculated player status
- Players are sorted by most recent activity (latest transaction first)
- The `transactions` field is always a list, never `None`
- Players can have multiple join/leave cycles (rejoining after leaving)
- Transaction dates can be `None` - always check before formatting
