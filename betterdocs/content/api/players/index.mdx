import vlrdevapi as vlr

# Get player profile
player = vlr.players.profile(player_id=123)
if player:
    print(f"{player.handle} ({player.real_name})")
    print(f"Country: {player.country}")
    
    # Show current teams
    for team in player.current_teams:
        print(f"  Current: {team.name} ({team.role})")

# Get agent stats
stats = vlr.players.agent_stats(player_id=123, timespan="90d")
for s in stats[:3]:
    print(f"{s.agent}: {s.acs} ACS, {s.rating} Rating")
```

## Notes

- Returns `None`/`[]` on network failure to keep flows simple.
- Player IDs can be found via search or from match/team rosters.
- Agent stats support timespans: "all", "60d", "90d".
