## Quick Example

```python title="Search for teams and players"
import vlrdevapi
import time

# Unified search
results = vlrdevapi.search.search("sentinels")
print(f"Total results: {results.total_results}")

# Players
for p in results.players:
    print(f"Player: {p.ign} ({p.real_name}) - {p.country}")
    time.sleep(0.5)  # Small delay to avoid overwhelming the server

# Teams
for t in results.teams:
    status = "Inactive" if t.is_inactive else "Active"
    print(f"Team: {t.name} - {t.country} ({status})")
    time.sleep(0.5)  # Small delay to avoid overwhelming the server

# Or use specific search
players = vlrdevapi.search.search_players("tenz")
for p in players:
    print(f"{p.ign}: {p.url}")
    time.sleep(0.5)  # Small delay to avoid overwhelming the server
```

## Notes

- Network issues return empty categories. Always check lengths before iterating.
- Player and team results are enriched using `players.profile()` and `teams.info()` when possible.
- Use specific helpers like `search_players()` if you only need one type.
