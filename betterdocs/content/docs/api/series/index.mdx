## Quick Example

```python title="Get series details, map stats and performance data" tab="Code"
import vlrdevapi as vlr

# Get series header
series = vlr.series.info(match_id=511536)
if series:
    print(f"{series.event} - {series.event_phase}")
    print(f"{series.teams[0].name} vs {series.teams[1].name}")
    print(f"Score: {series.score[0]}-{series.score[1]}")
    print(f"Best of: {series.best_of}")
    
    # Show picks and bans
    for pick in series.picks:
        print(f"  {pick.team} picked {pick.map}")

# Get detailed map stats
maps = vlr.series.matches(series_id=511536)
for map_data in maps:
    print(f"\nMap: {map_data.map_name}")
    for player in map_data.players[:5]:
        print(f"  {player.name}: {player.acs} ACS, {player.k}/{player.d}/{player.a}")

# Get detailed performance statistics
perf = vlr.series.performance(series_id=511536)
all_maps = next((game for game in perf if game.game_id == "All"), None)
if all_maps:
    print(f"\nPerformance Summary:")
    for player in all_maps.player_performances:
        print(f"  {player.name}: {player.multi_2k} 2Ks, {player.clutch_1v1} 1v1s, {player.econ} ECON")
```

```python tab="Output"
# Series header with teams and score
# Map statistics for each map in the series
# Performance summary with multi-kills and clutches
