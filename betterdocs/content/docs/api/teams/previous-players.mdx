```

## Parameters

<TypeTable

## Return Value

**Type:** `list[PreviousPlayer]`

Returns a list of previous and current players sorted by most recent activity.

<TypeTable
  type={{
    player_id: {
      type: 'int | None',
      description: 'Player ID',
    },
    ign: {
      type: 'str | None',
      description: 'In-game name',
    },
    real_name: {
      type: 'str | None',
      description: 'Real name',
    },
    country: {
      type: 'str | None',
      description: 'Country',
    },
    position: {
      type: 'str | None',
      description: 'Position (e.g., "Player", "Head Coach")',
    },
    status: {
      type: 'str',
      typeDescription: '"Active" | "Left" | "Inactive" | "Unknown"',
      description: 'Calculated player status',
      required: true,
    },
    join_date: {
      type: 'date | None',
      description: 'Most recent join date',
    },
    leave_date: {
      type: 'date | None',
      description: 'Most recent leave/inactive date',
    },
    transactions: {
      type: 'list[PlayerTransaction]',
      description: 'All transactions for this player (always a list, may be empty)',
      required: true,
    },
  }}
/>

## Status Determination

Status is calculated from the most recent transaction with a known date:

- **Active**: Player has joined and has no subsequent leave/inactive action
- **Left**: Player has a "leave" action as their most recent status change
- **Inactive**: Player has an "inactive" action as their most recent status change
- **Unknown**: Cannot determine status from available transactions

## Examples

### Get Previous Players

```python title="Get previous players"
import vlrdevapi as vlr

# Get all players
players = vlr.teams.previous_players(team_id=1034)

print(f"Total players: {len(players)}")
for player in players[:10]:  # Show first 10
    print(f"{player.ign} - {player.status} ({player.position})")
    join_str = player.join_date.strftime('%Y/%m/%d') if player.join_date else 'Unknown'
    leave_str = player.leave_date.strftime('%Y/%m/%d') if player.leave_date else 'None'
    print(f"  Joined: {join_str}, Left: {leave_str}")
```

### Filter by Status

```python title="Filter by status"
import vlrdevapi as vlr

players = vlr.teams.previous_players(team_id=1034)

# Filter by status
active = [p for p in players if p.status == "Active"]
left = [p for p in players if p.status == "Left"]
inactive = [p for p in players if p.status == "Inactive"]

print(f"Active: {len(active)}")
print(f"Left: {len(left)}")
print(f"Inactive: {len(inactive)}")

# Show active players
for player in active:
    print(f"  {player.ign} - {player.position}")
```


## Error Handling

- **Network failures**: Returns an empty list `[]`
- **Invalid team ID**: Returns an empty list `[]`
- **No transactions**: Returns an empty list `[]`
- **Players without player_id**: Excluded from results

The function never raises exceptions, making it safe to use without try-catch blocks.
